# Pizzeria The King
Thank so this pratical experience, I could understand the immediatekey differences between GitHub Pages and AWS S3

Time required to host your website:
- GitHub: 2 minutes.
- AWS: 6/7 minutes.

The repository/bucket must be public:
- GitHub: ✔️
- AWS: ❌

Free hosting:
- GitHub: ✔️
- AWS: ❗Independently from the use, you have 1 year of free tier powered by AWS. With less than 15GB of data transfer, less than 20K GET requests and 2K PUT requested (for a month), Your S3 instance will be free during all the free year tier.

Ability to choose the Datacenter Region in order to decrease latency:
- GitHub: ❌
- AWS: ✔️

Frequent updates:
- GitHub: ✔️ it's enough to push in the default branch of the repository and see the changes within 2/3 minutes most of the time.
- AWS: ❗ If you want to be fast and avoid to update all the files manually via the AWS Portal, you have to set up a pipeline to trigger a lambda function every time that a push/commit has been made to the S3 bucket and simply wait for that the lambda function will update anything for you.
